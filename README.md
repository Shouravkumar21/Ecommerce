E-commerce (electronic commerce or EC) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the Internet. These business transactions occur either as business-to-business, business-to consumer, consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business.
E-commerce shops have become part of our daily lives. Technological advancement has
made it possible for people to sit in the convenience of their homes and still shop online
without going to a physical shop. Africans have also joined the trend of e-commerce
business, so this project is meant to design an e-commerce online shop so that the people in Ghana (Africa)will be able to purchase their goods and services online.
